# NPC-Pathing
Coded in LuaU, through Roblox Studio

Hello ðŸ‘‹ This is my first ever small project I worked on alone created in Roblox Studio. I noticed that many online tutorials on NPC pathfinding rely on placing multiple parts along predefined pathways. However, I wanted to approach this differently by allowing the NPC to move autonomously and unpredictably while only using a single part as its anchor. The result is an NPC that navigates its environment at random intervals, showcasing a cleaner and more dynamic approach to pathfinding. I hope you find this project helpful and enjoyable!
